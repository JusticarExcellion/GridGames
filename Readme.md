# Grid Games ( Title WIP )

### Description:

A 3rd Person, Tron-like where you are a gladiator fighting in the arena in a virtual alien world. Mount your motorcycle, defeat your opponents, and earn your freedom!

### Mechanics:

The objective of the game is to destroy all enemy combatants and survive each level. The player begins a level of the game in an arena, where they control a motorcycle where you can activate or deactivate a light trail. Should the light trail be on, your motorcycle will have reduced speed and maneuverability, but it emits a trail from the back of the motorcycle that damages all combatants (including you) should they come into contact with it, the light trail will begin to decay after a certain amount of time clearing up the arena to maneuver. When the light trail is off your speed and maneuverability is restored. The player can also press a button to boost to try and get ahead of an opponent and cut them off, but the boost will take time to recharge, so time it carefully! Enemy Combatants also have the same motorcycle that functions the same way so be careful!

 In some levels, powerups will be scattered around the arena: some powerups will recharge your boost immediately and give you an additional boost. Others will allow you to pass through anyone (including your own) light trails or they can grant you a temporary special item you can use on opponents. 

The environment is also a tool to be used, with ramps and underground sections allowing you to get the literal jump on enemies or to give you room to make a daring escape. 

The core loop of the game will be to survive all levels by using your boosts, powerups, and the environment to destroy all enemy combatants. Should you die, this will cause you to restart the level.
