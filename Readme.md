### Description:

A 3rd Person, Tron-like where you are a gladiator fighting in the arena in a virtual alien world. Mount your motorcycle, defeat your opponents, and earn your freedom!

### Mechanics:

You are a gladiator fighting in a digital arena, to overcome the challenges in the arena, you will have to master your sparring cycle. Using your cycle's boost at just the right time to cut in front of your opponents, or use it to evade from attacking enemies.

As you manuever around the you should be careful and avoid the laser grids and pits placed around each level as these will cause some damage to your cycle, but more importantly it will reduce your speed allowing your opponents to catch up with you.

There are 2 enemy types to fight in the game, Seekers, and Interceptors. seekers are the standard enemies that you will face in the arena. Interceptors are faster and more aggressive variants with a lot more health. Each enemy type will look to try and cut you off while activating their own light trail in order to destroy you.

To assist you healing items have been placed around the arena, if you become damaged you should do your best to avoid your enemies, pickup and use these healing items before you are destroyed!!!
